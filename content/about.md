Hi there, 

happy to welcome you on the site. I'm Peter and have a passion for data visualization and statistical programming. Currently, I'm doing my PhD in economics at JKU Linz, Austria. 
Before that, I worked in the finance industry for about three years. I was part of the research department, so quite close to what I'm doing now. However, 
the PhD allows me to further deepen my knowledge in model building, which was rarely possible during my time in the finance industry.
