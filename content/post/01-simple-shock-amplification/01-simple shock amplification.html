<h1>Idea</h1>
<p>Following the <em>KISS</em> principle of modeling I start with the simplest model
possible to investigate shock amplifications in the global trade network. The
question is how shocks at the micro/sector level may trigger major global
economic shocks.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the simplest trade model possible and look at a world with only
one good and two countries, let’s say China and the United States, where China
is the supplier of raw materials and the U.S. uses these materials to produce
consumption goods for U.S. citizens. In this model (see figure
<span class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:supply-chain1}\)</span>), shocks evolve linear (no amplification) and affect
each country equally.</p>

<div id="supply-chain-2" class="section level2">
<h2>Supply Chain 2</h2>
<p>If we add a second good to the economy (see figure <span class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:supply-chain2}\)</span>),
things may change. Let’s say the U.S. needs 75 of good 1 and 25 of good 2 to
produce 100 of good 3. Assume another 10% shock hits the Chinese economy,
however, the crisis only affects good 2. Hence, output of good 2 drops from 25
to 15. While the total shock for China is still 10%, things changed considerably
for the United States as output drops by 40% (<span class="math inline">\(10/25=40\%\)</span>).</p>

<h2>Supply Chain 3</h2>
<p><em>Supply chain 2</em> is a simple example of how sector-specific shocks in one country may
amplify. What we also see is that countries at the end of the supply chain are
more vulnerable than countries at the beginning as they depend on many more
countries. To see this we do one more simple example of probability of default.
Let’s assume at each link in figure <span class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:supply-chain3}\)</span> has a
probability of default of 5%. This results in the following default
probabilities: India = <span class="math inline">\(5\%\)</span>, France <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow 1-0.95^2=9.8\%\)</span>, and the U.S.
<span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow 1-0.95^3=14.3\%\)</span>.</p>

<div id="conclusion-and-what-is-missing" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclusion and what is missing</h2>
<ul>
<li>Shocks may amplify depending on which industries and countries are affected.</li>
<li>Later stages of the supply chain bear higher risks.</li>
<li>If available, good 2 can be sourced from other suppliers, hence, the shock
would be dampened. Prices might go up.</li>
<li>A shock can be (temporarily) mitigated by domestic stocks.</li>
<li>There will be repercussions. If the U.S. experiences a dramatic drop in
economic output industry 2 will also be affected. Hence, the shock will also hit
China stronger than initially expected.</li>
